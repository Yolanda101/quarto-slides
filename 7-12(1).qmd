# Model 2 and Transformation Explanation

## Model 2 Formula

The formula for Model 2 is shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Ages} = & \ 9.9511 - 0.6186 \cdot \text{Sex}_I - 0.0422 \cdot \text{Sex}_M - 2.3134 \cdot \log(\text{Diameter}) \\
              & + 1.2117 \cdot \log(\text{Height}) + 7.0433 \cdot \log(\text{Whole_weight}) \\
              & - 6.8653 \cdot \log(\text{Shucked_weight}) - 1.4109 \cdot \log(\text{Viscera_weight}) \\
              & + 3.9254 \cdot \log(\text{Shell_weight}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

The transformation in Model 2 is primarily aimed at improving the model's ability to meet the assumptions of linear regression, specifically:Linearity, Reducing Skewness, Homoscedasticity, Normality of Residuals.

The log-transformed predictor variables generally exhibit a linear relationship with Ages, as expected in a linear regression model.

Model 2 exhibits problems with non-normal residuals (especially in the tails) and heteroscedasticity, as seen in both the QQ plot and residuals vs fitted plot. This suggests that the assumptions of linear regression are violated. \# Model 3 and Transformation Explanation

## Model 3 Formula

The formula for **Model 3** with the inverse of **Ages** as the response variable is shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text{Ages}} = & \ 0.0581 + 0.0034 \cdot \text{Sex}_I - 0.0004 \cdot \text{Sex}_M - 0.0126 \cdot \log(\text{Diameter}) \\
                        & - 0.0110 \cdot \log(\text{Height}) - 0.0325 \cdot \log(\text{Whole_weight}) \\
                        & + 0.0399 \cdot \log(\text{Shucked_weight}) + 0.0040 \cdot \log(\text{Viscera_weight}) \\
                        & - 0.0277 \cdot \log(\text{Shell_weight}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

the model exhibits a more linear relationship between the response and predictors

the model adequately satisfies the linearity assumption, with only minor deviations for some predictors.

# A3-A4

![](model3qq.png){fig-width="80%"}

![](model3resi.png){fig-width="80%"} Model 3 improves significantly on these issues, showing better normality of residuals and addressing heteroscedasticity. The inverse transformation applied in Model 3 has helped stabilize the variance and improve the overall model fit.
