# Model 2 and Transformation Explanation

## Model 2 Formula

The formula for Model 2 is shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Ages} = & \ \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Sex}_{I} + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Sex}_{M} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{Diameter} \\
              & + \beta_4 \cdot \log(\text{Height}) + \beta_5 \cdot \text{Whole\_weight} \\
              & + \beta_6 \cdot \text{Shucked\_weight} + \beta_7 \cdot \log(\text{Viscera\_weight}) \\
              & + \beta_8 \cdot \log(\text{Shell\_weight}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$ The transformation in Model 2 is primarily aimed at improving the model's ability to meet the assumptions of linear regression, specifically:Linearity, Reducing Skewness, Homoscedasticity, Normality of Residuals.

The log-transformed predictor variables generally exhibit a linear relationship with Ages, as expected in a linear regression model.

Model 2 exhibits problems with non-normal residuals (especially in the tails) and heteroscedasticity, as seen in both the QQ plot and residuals vs fitted plot. This suggests that the assumptions of linear regression are violated. \# Model 3 and Transformation Explanation


## Model 3 Formula

The formula for **Model 3** with the inverse of **Ages** as the response variable is shown below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{\text{Ages}} = & \ \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Sex}_I + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Sex}_M + \beta_3 \cdot \log(\text{Diameter}) \\
                        & + \beta_4 \cdot \log(\text{Height}) + \beta_5 \cdot \log(\text{Whole\_weight}) \\
                        & + \beta_6 \cdot \log(\text{Shucked\_weight}) + \beta_7 \cdot \log(\text{Viscera\_weight}) \\
                        & + \beta_8 \cdot \log(\text{Shell\_weight}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

the model exhibits a more linear relationship between the response and predictors

# model 3 Linearity check

the model adequately satisfies the linearity assumption, with only minor deviations for some predictors.

# A3-A4

![](model3resi.png){fig-width="80%"} Model 3 improves significantly on these issues, showing better normality of residuals and addressing heteroscedasticity. The inverse transformation applied in Model 3 has helped stabilize the variance and improve the overall model fit.
